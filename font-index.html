	<div class="intro">Mood boards for inspiration have been a staple in the<br>photography
	industry for decades. Nowadays, we have<br>so much visual inspiration at our fingertips.
	We took the<br>liberty to start your go-to list for visually tantalizing shows<br>on Netflix.</div>

	<div class="crown-title">THE CROWN</div>
	<div class="crown-desc">This Netflix Original is one example of a show<br>
	whose cinematography and direction, in my<br>opinion, far outshines actual plot intrigue. The<br>
	show follows the life of Queen Elizabeth, which<br>may interest some, but--even though the acting<br>
	is spectacular--others, myself included, recoil at<br>the thought of watching a British history piece.<br>
	That said, I'm a huge fan, and it's because of<br>the show's incredible cinematography which<br>captures a
	consistently delightful tone, somehow<br>as soft and graceful as it is, in a sense, eerie.<br>
	Cinematographer Adriano Goldman steers clear<br>of bold color in most cases, opting for a clean<br>
	look that is concise and regal, as it should be.<br>this results in an almost ghostly cinema style<br>
	that exudes elegance.</div>

	<div class="dot2"></div>
	<div class="stranger-title">STRANGER THINGS</div>
	<div class="stranger-desc">The sci-fi smash hit's solid cinematography, the work of Tim
	Ives is perhaps<br>the key ingredient in establishing the <i>Stranger Things'</i> overall
	tone, one which<br>captures that unmissable 80's nostalgia but in a modern and vibrant way.
	Ives<br>hits the nail on the head in offering a depiction of suburban life that's true to
	it's<br>time--aside from the monsters and parallel worlds--in a relatively lo-fi quality,<br>
	but withstyle and color that only today's technological advancements could<br>allow. Be it
	the Byer's dullish house entwined in radiant Christmas lights or<br>the local arcade with
	it's striking mix of color, <i>Stranger Things'</i> cinematography<br>allows for an accurate,
	thoroughly enjoyable decade piece that's in no way<br>lacking in modernity.</div>
	<div class="altered"><img src="https://github.com/DScott5/Device-Agnostic/blob/master/IMG/Edited/screen-shot-2018-01-11-at-11-11-44-am.png?raw=true"></div>
	<div class="dot3"></div>
	<div class="altered-title">ALTERED CARBON</div>
	<div class="altered-desc">Generally, in television, when a show is set in<br>a technologically rampant future,
	maintaining<br>a believable and consistent visual quality on a<br>grand scale tends to be rather difficult due
	to<br>budget constraints. <i>Altered Carbon</i>, however,<br> breaks that trend. The world manages to<br>feel
	lived-in and real, with CGI enhancing the<br>experience rather than distracting from it. The<br> cinematography
	meanwhile blends the darkness<br>of a gritty reality with a colorful popping neon<br>future, creating a visual
	feast that immerses<br>the viewer completely. Though the general<br>consensus is that Netflix's show is worth<br>
	watching, those on the fence might be swayed<br>to check it out just to see the impressive visuals.</div>
	<div class="end"><img src="https://github.com/DScott5/Device-Agnostic/blob/master/IMG/Edited/the-end-of-the-fing-world-bastidores.jpg?raw=true"></div>
	<div class="dot4"></div>
	<div class="end-title">THE END OF THE FUCKING WORLD</div>
	<div class="end-desc">Directed by Jonathan Entwistle and Lucy<br>Tcherniak, this mini-series is based off of a<br>
	graphic novel. The story of a psychopath and a<br>loudmouth, the show takes notes from movies<br>like Fargo and
	Twin Peaks in the way that it is<br>visually constructed. The cinematographers<br>experiment with highly contrasted
	colors<br>and intense angles, especially when the<br>characters are in trouble or are about to<br>be. The establishing
	shot of each episode<br>typically features the main characters, James<br>and Alyssa, in the center of the frame. Their<br>
	emotions set the mood for the rest of the scene.<br> They are consistently framed by symmetrical<br>backgrounds--a gentle
	reminder that the rest<br> of the world is painfully normal as they move<br>along their suburban-noir quest.<br></div>
