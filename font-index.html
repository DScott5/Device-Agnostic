	<p class="stranger-title">STRANGER THINGS
	<p class="dot1">
	<p class="stranger-desc">The sci-fi smash hit's solid cinematography, the work of Tim
	Ives is perhaps<br>the key ingredient in establishing the <i>Stranger Things'</i> overall
	tone, one which<br>captures that unmissable 80's nostalgia but in a modern and vibrant way.
	Ives<br>hits the nail on the head in offering a depiction of suburban life that's true to
	it's<br>time--aside from the monsters and parallel worlds--in a relatively lo-fi quality,<br>
	but withstyle and color that only today's technological advancements could<br>allow. Be it
	the Byer's dullish house entwined in radiant Christmas lights or<br>the local arcade with
	it's striking mix of color, <i>Stranger Things'</i> cinematography<br>allows for an accurate,
	thoroughly enjoyable decade piece that's in no way<br>lacking in modernity.
